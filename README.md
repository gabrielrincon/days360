# Days360

Calculates the difference between two dates based on the 360 day year used in interest calculations.

This gems aims to provide full compatibility to calculations based on Excel or Calc. The testsuite thus uses over a thousand date combinations especially picked to highlight problems in the days360 calculation. The reference values were calculated with different office suites using their provided methods (more information in test/data).
Additional calculation methods are also provided. See the Notes section to learn more about the different calculation methods and their history.

The following table gives an overview on which functions are supported and what their equivalents in Excel or Calc are.

## Notes on DAY360 calculations

Nowadays it seems senseless to calculate interest based on some fictional year instead of simply using the number of days between two dates. The reason (i believe) for different calculation methods to still be in use are:

* history - Before we had computers it was hard calculating interest to the real number of days :) 
* legacy data/calculations - Changing the calculation would make "older" calculations look wrong. Thats also the reason why Excel and Calc actually stick to a buggy version of DAYS360
* Comparison - Comparing interest from different years and months is easier using days360 as all months have the same length. Thus the interest for the same amount of mony does not differ from month to month or in between years (remember leap years!)

## Contributing

There are a huge amount of different calculation methods out there (see ISDA page for a beginning). If you need a different one you are invited to add it. Please make sure you have some kind of documentation and ideally a test vector (see test/data) with reference results.
